    user: 'username',
    password: 'password',

  };
  
  var myJob = { /* according to job scheduler documentation */ };

  var scheduler = new jobsc.Scheduler(options);
  var scJob = { job: myJob };

  scheduler.createJob(scJob, function (error, body) {
    if (error) {
      return console.log('Error registering new job %s', error);
    }
    // job was created successfully
    job.id = body._id; 
  });
